# Paint's Completionist Advancements Language File
# Some advancement titles make use of puns that work in English but probably not in other languages. You do not have to translate directly, you can be creative with it.
# In instances where strings appear to be missing, I'm using Minecraft's own translations, saving you work!
# This file will be updated with new advancements with each new update.
